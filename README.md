# Cracking the Coding Interview with Python
Repository for CTCI-Python project. The aim is implement/translate the solutions/code snippets from Java to Python3 present in the very popular book [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/). A soft copy of the book is present in the repository.

### Motivation
I had picked up the CTCI book to prepare for the internship season at my college, only to realize that all the solutions are in Java. Although it should not matter since the author does a great job of explaining the reasoning and logic behind the approach, still I and some of my friends feel that it would be helpful to have a codebase in a familiar language. And what's better than the weakly typed, loosely syntaxed, and everyone's favourite - Python 3.

### Contributing
Since there are 150+ questions in the book with many of them having multiple solutions, it would take a lot of time to write and check the solution to each question. Thus, Pull Requests are very much welcome. I have tried to keep the structure as clean and intuitive as I can. Please follow the same format while sending Pull Requests.

### Testing
I have not yet figured out how to test the solutions. My first thought is just writing unit tests for each solution, but I believe a better and faster solution exists. Feel free to share your opinion via an issue.
